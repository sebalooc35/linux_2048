# linux_2048
Hi! this is a 2048 game for a linux terminal, don't try to run it in windows since I used termios lib for reading from the console,
I hope you can try this in your linux server and enjoy while supervising your server!

btw you can save your current game and see the scoreboard because of the txt file so don't delete it.
